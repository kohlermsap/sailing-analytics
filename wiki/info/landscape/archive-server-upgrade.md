# Archive Server Upgrade

## TL;DR

- Optionally, to accelerate DB reads, launch MongoDB replica for ``archive`` replica set (see [here](https://security-service.sapsailing.com/gwt/AdminConsole.html#LandscapeManagementPlace:)); wait until MongoDB replica is in ``SECONDARY`` state
- Launch "more like this" based on existing primary archive, adjusting the ``INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE`` user data entry to the release of choice and the ``Name`` tag to "SL Archive (New Candidate)" and adjusting the availability zone (AZ) such that it does not equal the AZ of the current production ARCHIVE and ideally has either the central reverse proxy or a disposable reverse proxy in that AZ so that cross-AZ traffic is avoided.
- Wait until the new instance is done with its background tasks and CPU utilization goes to 0% (approximately 48h)
- Create an entry in the reverse proxy's ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/001-events.conf`` file like this:
```
  Use Plain archive-candidate.sapsailing.com 172.31.46.203 8888
```
with ``172.31.46.203`` being an example of the internal IP address your new archive candidate instance got assigned.
 - Check the configuration by running ``httpd -t``. If you get an "OK" as the output, commit and distribute the configuration change to all reverse proxies like this:
```
  git checkout main
  git commit -a
  git push
```
This will disseminate the configuration to all reverse proxies through a Git hook, merge as required and check out the appropriate configuration for that environment again, then reload the configuration in ``httpd``.
- Compare server contents, either with ``compareServers`` script and fix any differences
```
  java/target/compareServers -ael https://www.sapsailing.com https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com
```
which uses the REST API to run a full comparison, showing the differences in JSON format; and/or
```
  java/target/compareServers -el https://www.sapsailing.com https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com
```
which runs a rather "classic" comparison of the leaderboard groups' JSON representations, showing regular "diff" output and stopping at the first leaderboard group that has differences. After having fixed the differences, you can continue with the previously differing leaderboard group using the ``-c`` option, like this:
```
  java/target/compareServers -cel https://www.sapsailing.com https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com
```
- Do some spot checks on the new instance using the ``https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com`` domain. Note that some links may lead back to the production instance ``www.sapsailing.com`` and replace ``www`` by ``archive-candidate`` accordingly in the URL in these cases.
- Switch reverse proxy, by adjusting the archive IP definitions at the top of ``root@sapsailing.com:/etc/httpd/conf.d/000-macros.conf``. The file contains two lines close to its top, looking like this:
```
Define ARCHIVE_IP 172.31.42.246
Define ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP 172.31.45.7
```
Comment out or delete the ``ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP`` line. Change ``ARCHIVE_IP`` into ``ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP`` to "demote" the current production ARCHIVE to being the failover instance. Insert a new ``ARCHIVE_IP`` definition with the internal IP address of the new archive server. Then, to check and then activate the changes, again:
```
  httpd -t   # ensure you get "OK" as the response
  git checkout main
  git commit -a
  git push
```
- Terminate old fail-over EC2 instance; you will have to disable its termination protection first.
- Adjust Name tags for what is now the fail-over and what is now the primary archive server in EC2 console

## Details

### Landscape Overview

We currently afford a primary archive server that holds all historic "featured" events (other than club-level and self-serviced events that may continue to be hosted in specific club servers or the "my" environment). Additionally, there is a fail-over archive server that we maintain to be one release behind the primary archive server. The archive server implements the landing page for [sapsailing.com](https://sapsailing.com) and hence should have high availability. Reloading the entire archive takes several hours, so losing the primary archive server without having any sort of fail-over would cause a downtime that long.

Keeping the fail-over archive server one or more releases behind the primary archive is intended to cover the case where a new release introduces a defect that went unnoticed during quality assurance measures such as the automated tests run during the build process and the mandatory archive server content comparison before switching to a new primary archive, as well as manual spot checks on one or more events. Again, if such a defect turns out to be a show stopper, having to start up a new archive server would keep the show stopper situation for several hours.

The archive servers (primary and fail-over) are sized based on how we have observed the workload over the past years. Except for the archiving process of a new event, the archive server's workload is a read-mostly workload. No continuous data ingestion is happening, caches will be stable and well-filled after a while for the popular events, and user contention is low. At the time of this writing (2022-01-06) we see approximately 2,000 unique visitors per day browsing the archived events.

This type of workload doesn't require all data to be held in physical memory at all times. Instead, a memory architecture with plentiful fast (NVMe-based) swap space and an amount of physical memory that can easily fit a few "hot" events seems sufficient. This is currently accomodated by an ``i3.2xlarge`` instance type that comes with 62GB physical RAM and close to 2TB of available NVMe disk space used as swap area.

With this, we can size the Java VM such that it can easily hold the archive content. Currently, 300GB of heap size are sufficient, and this shouldn't be overprovisioned as garbage collection processes would take unnecessarily long.

The [archive server environment](https://releases.sapsailing.com/environments/archive-server) specifies most of what the server configuration needs. In addition to that, only the release to install and the bearer token for a user account that allows the archive server to replicate ``security-service.sapsailing.com`` need to be provided in the user data:

```
    USE_ENVIRONMENT=archive-server
    INSTALL_FROM_RELEASE=build-202112281809
    REPLICATE_MASTER_BEARER_TOKEN="..."
```

### Launching a MongoDB Replica for Replica Set ``archive``

The archive servers use a dedicated MongoDB replica set ``mongodb://dbserver.internal.sapsailing.com:10201/winddb?replicaSet=archive&retryWrites=true&readPreference=secondaryPreferred``. Obviously, loading an archive server will put some stress on this replica set which by default runs only a single MongoDB instance on the ``dbserver.internal.sapsailing.com`` host. To accelerate the loading process it is a good idea to fire up a MongoDB replica for this replica set. Based on the ``secondaryPreferred`` read preference the new archive server candidate will read from a ``SECONDARY`` replica which can be set up to have enough memory and CPUs to make the loading process quicker. Again ``i3.2xlarge`` is a good choice for now.

To check the state of your new MongoDB replica, try this:
```
  $ ssh -A trac@sapsailing.com
  $ ssh -A ec2-user@dbserver.internal.sapsailing.com
  $ mongo "mongodb://localhost:10201/?replicaSet=archive&retryWrites=true"
  archive:PRIMARY> rs.status()
```
This will show you the replica set configuration from MongoDB's perspective. In the ``members`` array you should see two instances, one of which being the ``dbserver.internal.sapsailing.com:10201`` primary. Your to-be secondary server will likely be listed as the second member (index 1) in that array, and you will continue to see a ``stateStr`` of ``STARTUP2`` for a few hours until it changes to ``SECONDARY``.

### Launching the EC2 Instance

When the MongoDB replica is available (in state ``SECONDARY`` after going through the lengthy ``STARTUP2`` phase) a new archive server candidate can be launched. A quick approach is to select the existing primary archive server in the [EC2 instances list](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:instanceState=running;search=SL%20Archive;sort=tag:Name) and choose "Launch more like this" from the context menu, then adjust the instance's user data for the correct release and set the ``Name`` tag from "SL Archive" to something like "SL Archive (New Candidate)" so you can discern it from the production and fail-over archive and launch the new instance.

The instance will start up, install the release as specified and launch the Java VM which then goes about replicating ``security-service.sapsailing.com`` and loading all archived content from the MongoDB ``archive`` replica set. This will take a few hours. During the process you can monitor the loading progress under the new archive candidate's ``/gwt/status`` URL. Use the instance's external IP and make it into a URL such as ``http://1.2.3.4:8888/gwt/status``. Watch out for the fields ``numberofracestorestore`` and ``numberofracesrestored``. The latter will converge towards the former which finally should put the overall ``available`` field to ``true``.

But note: having launched the loading of all races doesn't make the new archive candidate present all content in the proper form yet. Many background processes will keep running for several more hours, computing maneuvers and from them updating wind estimations. You should let the process finish before running the mandatory archive server content comparison. One way to track these background processes is by looking at the EC2 console's instance monitoring and there the CPU Utilization chart. You will clearly see when the CPU utilization drops from 100% to 0% when the background processes are done. Instead, you may choose to ssh into the instance and run a ``top`` command or similar and track CPU load. Alternatively, track the ``/home/sailing/servers/server/logs/sailing0.log.0`` file on the new archive server candidate. It will contain lines of the sort
```
INFO: Thread&#91;MarkPassingCalculator for race R14 initialization,4,main&#93;: Timeout waiting for future task com.sap.sse.util.impl.ThreadPoolAwareFutureTask@39f29211 (retrying); scheduled with executor com.sap.sse.util.impl.NamedTracingScheduledThreadPoolExecutor@51517746\[Running, pool size = 7, active threads = 7, queued tasks = 352521, completed tasks = 610095\]\[name=Default background executor\]
```
that will keep repeating. Watch out for the ``queued tasks`` count. It should be decreasing, and when done it should go down to 0 eventually, although you may not see a log entry with "queued tasks = 0" necessarily.

### Create a Temporary Mapping in ``/etc/httpd/conf.d/001-events.conf`` to Make New Server Accessible Before Switching

Grab the internal IP address of your freshly launched archive server candidate (something like 172.31.x.x) and ensure you have a line of the form

```
    Use Plain archive-candidate.sapsailing.com 172.31.35.213 8888
```

in the file ``root@sapsailing.com:/etc/httpd/conf.d/001-events.conf``, preferably towards the top of the file where it can be quickly found. Save the changes and check the configuration using the ``apachectl configtest`` or the equivalend ``httpd -t`` command. It should give an output saying ``Syntax OK``. Only in this case reload the configuration by issuing the ``service httpd reload`` command as user ``root``. After this command has completed, you can watch your archive server candidate start up at [https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com/gwt/status](https://archive-candidate.sapsailing.com/gwt/status) and make any changes necessary when the ``compareServers`` script (see below) notifies you of any differences that need handling.

### Comparing Contents with Primary ARCHIVE Server

This is when you can move on to comparing the new candidate's contents with the primary archive server. Two ways are currently possible.

#### ``compareServers`` Script

The first uses the ``compareServers`` script that you find in the Git repository in the ``java/target/`` directory. The script will fetch various documents, so it is a good idea to create a new empty directory and change into that new directory before starting the script. Start it like this:
```
    mkdir compareServers
    cd compareServers
    ${GIT_ROOT}/java/target/compareServers -el https://www.sapsailing.com http://1.2.3.4:8888
```
where ``1.2.3.4`` is assumed to be the external IP address of your new archive server candidate. The script will fetch the leaderboard groups available on both servers and then compare their contents one by one. Should a difference be observed, the difference is printed to the standard error stream and the comparison stops. You must then fix the problem and continue the comparison, starting at the previously different leaderboard group, with the following command, adding the ``-c`` option ("continue"):
```
    ${GIT_ROOT}/java/target/compareServers -cel https://www.sapsailing.com http://1.2.3.4:8888
```
Repeat until no differences are found anymore.

#### REST API ``/sailingserver/api/v1/compareservers``

Alternatively, you can use the [REST API for comparing server contents](https://www.sapsailing.com/sailingserver/webservices/api/v1/compareServers.html). Example:
```
curl https://www.sapsailing.com/sailingserver/api/v1/compareservers -d "server2=1.2.3.4:8888"
```
Differences are reported in a JSON response document. If no differences are found, you will see a response document like this:
```
        {
         "34.242.227.113:8888": [],
         "1.2.3.4:8888": []
        }
```
In this example, ``34.242.227.113`` would be the public IP address of the server that responded to the ``www.sapsailing.com`` request (the current primary archive server), and ``1.2.3.4`` would be the public IP address of your new candidate archive server. The response status will be ``200`` if the comparison was ok, and ``409`` otherwise. Handle differences are described for the ``compareServers`` script above.

You can also trigger the REST API-based comparison by using the ``-a`` option of the ``compareServers`` script.

### Manual Spot Checks

Following the mandatory automated content comparison you should do a few spot checks on the new archive server candidate. Go to ``http://1.2.3.4:8888/gwt/Home.html`` if ``1.2.3.4`` is the public IP address of your new archive server candidate and browse through a few events. Note that clicking on a link to show all events will get you back to ``www.sapsailing.com``. In this case, replace ``www.sapsailing.com`` by your candidate server's public IP address again and continue browsing.

### Switching in Reverse Proxy

Once you are content with the quality of the new archive server candidate's contents it's time to switch. Technically, switching archive servers is done by adjusting the corresponding configuration, in the central Apache reverse proxy server. You find this in ``root@sapsailing.com:/etc/httpd/conf.d/000-macros.conf`` at the top.  The current macros file is as follows:

```
Define ARCHIVE_IP 172.31.43.140
Define ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP 172.31.9.8
Define PRODUCTION_ARCHIVE ${ARCHIVE_IP}

<Macro ArchiveRewrite>
        Use Rewrite ${PRODUCTION_ARCHIVE} 8888
</Macro>
```

When the new archive is ready, duplicate the "Define ARCHIVE_IP....." line; comment the first one; and then change the ip
of the second one to be the upgraded archive's private IP. Set the "Define ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP....." value to the now old primary. Also make sure "Define PRODUCTION_ARCHIVE...." is a pointer to the archive value, by setting it to `${ARCHIVE_IP}`. It should look something like below (if the new IP
is 172.31.7.12):

```
#Define ARCHIVE_IP 172.31.43.140  # comment the old primary
Define ARCHIVE_IP 172.31.7.12 # add the new upgraded item
Define ARCHIVE_FAILOVER_IP 172.31.43.140  # the old primary
Define PRODUCTION_ARCHIVE ${ARCHIVE_IP} #ensure this points to the new archive variable

<Macro ArchiveRewrite>
        Use Rewrite ${PRODUCTION_ARCHIVE} 8888
</Macro>
```

Then save and exit the editor. And enter `systemctl reload httpd`.
Check that the new archive service is now active, e.g., by looking at [sapsailing.com/gwt/status](https://sapsailing.com/gwt/status). It should reflect the new release in its ``release`` field. 

### Clean up EC2 Names and Instances

Next, you should terminate the previous fail-over archive server instance, and you need to adjust the ``Name`` tags in the EC2 console of the old primary to show that it's now the fail-over, and for the candidate to show that it's now the primary. Select the old fail-over instance and terminate it. Then change the name tag of "SL Archive" to "SL Archive (Failover)", then change that of "SL Archive (New Candidate)" to "SL Archive", and you're done for now....

If you need to upgrade this old failover then you can repeat the whole process.


### How we automated the automatic failover of the reverse proxy

We setup a script to be installed as a cronjob on the reverse proxy. It runs multiple curl checks to `/gwt/status` of the primary and if a healthy status code is returned then no change is made but, 
if multiple unhealthy status codes are returned, the PRODUCTION_IP definition (found at the top of the macros) is altered to point to the failover definition. Then a reload occurs
and various users are notified by email. If it returns to healthy, then the definition returns to point to the definition of the main archive: `${ARCHIVE_IP}`.
Note that we only reload, edit or send emails if the "new" status differs to what the macros file already displays.
