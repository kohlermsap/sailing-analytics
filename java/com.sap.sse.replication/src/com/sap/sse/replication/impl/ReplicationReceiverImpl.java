     * If further calls to this method occur, the maximum delivery tag value is recorded such that if the task gets its turn, a cumulative
     * acknowledgement takes place.<p>
     * 
     * Acknowledgements must be sent in strictly monotonous order. Therefore, task scheduling must be synchronized with incrementing
     * the delivery tag number to acknowledge. With a thread pool, task execution order is generally unpredictable. At the same time,
     * the synchronous part of acknowledgement handling must stay short in order not to hold up the actual payload processing.
     * The synchronous part therefore shall only check quickly for the presence of a yet unlaunched task, and this check will have to
     * be synchronized with the beginning of each task before it reads the latest delivery tag to acknowledge. An {@link AtomicInteger}
     * is used to count the number of not yet started tasks. This method will first increment the delivery tag to confim, then check
     * the atomic integer for a yet unstarted task. Since {@link AtomicInteger} guarantees {@code volatile} semantics, if this value is
     * greater than zero, a task will definitely pick up the new delivery tag. Otherwise, the AtomicInteger is incremented (it may in the
     * meantime have been incremented by another thread), and a corresponding task is scheduled.<p>
     * 
     * The tasks themselves run {@code synchronized} on the {@link #acknowledgementTaskLock}. Therefore, only one can run at a time.
     * The first thing a task does is decrement the atomic integer counting the tasks yet unstarted. Then it reads the delivery tag to
     * acknowledge and compares it with the {@link #maximumDeliveryTagAcknowledged deliver tag last acknowledged}. Only if
     * {@link #maximumDeliveryTagSoFar} is greater than that, an acknowledgement is sent.
