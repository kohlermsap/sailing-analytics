/**
 * Manages the cache of {@link GPSFixDTOWithSpeedWindTackAndLegType}s for the competitors and the {@link Colorline}s
 * representing sub-sets of those fixes, encoding the tails that visualize the course the boats took. The fixes cached
 * for each competitor are intended to represent a contiguous segment of the competitor's track managed by the server. A
 * tail may show a sub-segment of the fixes cached for a competitor, for example, because new fixes are added to the end
 * of a competitors fixes cache, extending the contiguous cached segment beyond the length visualized by the tail. This
 * way, moving back and forth in time while updating the tail may sometimes be possible even without having to load more
 * data from the server. The last fix of a segment of cached fixes may be an
 * {@link GPSFixDTOWithSpeedWindTackAndLegType#extrapolated extrapolated} one. When a later (extrapolated or real) fix
 * is to be cached for that competitor, the earlier extrapolated fix is removed from the cache and, if currently
 * visualized on the tail, also from the tail.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The "contiguous condition" may be violated temporarily due to requests for data being executed asynchronously, with
 * results being processed out of order, and with compound requests getting dropped and only their position data request
 * being re-sent later.
 * <p>
 * 
 * If a competitor's tail is to be shown for a time range for which data is missing from the cache, and the time range
 * does not have an overlap with the cached time range, in order to maintain only contiguous track segments in the
 * cache, the previously cached fixes will be dropped from the cache, and a new contiguous segment will be started as
 * the response to the new request is processed. "In-flight" requests for data that would extend the previous track
 * segment will have their callbacks informed so that when processing the response they don't try to merge their fixes
 * into the cache anymore, basically dropping the fixes received to avoid cache inconsistencies.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Fixes can optionally be annotated with detail values that can be used to color the tail based on the respective
 * value. For example, the detail value may represent the boat's speed over ground (SOG) in knots, or its velocity made
 * good (VMG) in knots. The semantics of the detail value is described by a {@link DetailType}. Currently, the detail
 * values are always obtained together with the basic GPS fix data such as position and time point. As the user selects
 * a different detail type, the detail values of those competitors who have their tail colored based on the detail
 * values need to be updated to reflect the new detail type; this requires a re-load at least of the track segment
 * currently visualized for that competitor, dropping the data cached for that competitor so far. (See also bug 5925
 * which considers separating the detail values from the fixes.)
 * <p>
 * 
 * When showing colored tails, the color range is determined by monitoring minimum and maximum detail values across all
 * competitors for which colored tails are shown. The color range is adjusted in case the value range changes beyond a
 * certain threshold (see {@link ValueRangeFlexibleBoundaries}). To achieve this, adding fixes to a colored tail must
 * check the new fixes for extreme values; when removing a fix from a colored tail that had a minimal / maximal detail
 * value, that tail must be searched again for a new minimal / maximal value.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A client of an instance of this class (typically a {@link RaceMap}) interacts in three possible ways:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Preparing the requests that update the fixes cache: Based on the tail length and a "current time" (usually
 * defined by the {@link com.sap.sse.gwt.client.player.Timer Timer}'s
 * {@link com.sap.sse.gwt.client.player.Timer#getTime() time slider}), one or two requests including callback handlers
 * are returned: one for a quick request for only a short piece of the track, and optionally another one for a longer
 * piece of the track, where the remote call is expected to take a bit longer than we would like to wait with showing
 * the current boat position. The requests know the time ranges to request for which competitor, and they know whether
 * when processing their response they first need to {@link #clearTails() clear} the cache before entering new,
 * non-overlapping positions. The two requests are linked to each other and share the knowledge about whether the first
 * of them to process its response needs to clear the cache. The resulting time ranges already received or requested per
 * competitor are remembered and are used to trim subsequent request. Should later requests require a clearing of the
 * cache (such as after changing the detail type or when requesting a disconnected time range), requests still "in
 * flight" will have their callbacks informed so that they will discard the positions they will receive.</li>
 * <li>Processing the responses to those requests: The callbacks returned with the one or two requests from the previous
 * step check whether their results are still valid; if so, they use
 * {@link #updateFixes(Map, Map, long, boolean, DetailType)} to install the position fixes received in the cache and
 * either clear (in case the response started a new contiguous track segment) or incrementally update an existing
 * tail.</li>
 * <li>Request initial creation or incremental update of a competitor's tail: This is used to adjust the time range
 * for which the tail visualizes the cached fixes. Tail creation and update is largely independent of requesting and
 * updating cached fixes; instead, tail updates use the cached fixes currently available. Fixes being updated into
 * the cache upon receiving responses from the server will update the visible tails if they fall into the desired
 * visible time range.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * This class offers methods to update the fixes and the tails, making sure that the data is always managed
 * consistently. In particular, it keeps an eye on {@link GPSFixDTOWithSpeedWindTackAndLegType#extrapolated extrapolated
 * fixes}. Those are just a guess where a boat may have been and will need to be removed once actual data for that time
 * is available.

     * for the competitor. Otherwise, the fixes received in <code>result</code> replace those known so far for the
     * respective competitor. The {@link #tailsByCompetitorIdsAsStrings} affected by these fixes are updated accordingly when modifications fall
     * inside the interval shown by the tail, as defined by {@link #firstShownFixByCompetitorIdsAsStrings} and {@link #lastShownFixByCompetitorIdsAsStrings}. The tails
     * are, however, not trimmed according to the specification for the tail length. This has to happen elsewhere (see

     * @param overlapsWithKnownFixes
     *            if for a competitor whose fixes are provided in <code>fixesForCompetitors</code> this holds
     *            <code>false</code>, any fixes previously stored for that competitor are removed, and the tail is
     *            deleted from the map (see {@link #removeTail(CompetitorWithBoatDTO)}); the new fixes are then added to the
     *            {@link #fixesByCompetitorIdsAsStrings} map, and a new tail will have to be constructed as needed (does not happen here). If
     *            this map holds <code>true</code>, {@link #mergeFixes(CompetitorWithBoatDTO, List, long)} is used to merge the
     *            new fixes from <code>fixesForCompetitors</code> into the {@link #fixesByCompetitorIdsAsStrings} collection, and the tail is
     *            left unchanged. <b>NOTE:</b> When a non-overlapping set of fixes is updated (<code>false</code>), this
     *            map's record for the competitor is <b>UPDATED</b> to <code>true</code> after the tail deletion and
     *            {@link #fixesByCompetitorIdsAsStrings} replacement has taken place. This helps in cases where this update is only one of two
     *            into which an original request was split (one quick update of the tail's head and another one for the
     *            longer tail itself), such that the second request that uses the <em>same</em> map will be considered
     *            having an overlap now, not leading to a replacement of the previous update originating from the same
