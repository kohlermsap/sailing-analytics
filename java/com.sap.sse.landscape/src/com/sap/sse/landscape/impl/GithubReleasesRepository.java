/**
 * Can enumerate the {@link Release}s published by a GitHub repository and search releases whose name starts with a
 * specific prefix. This assumes a public GitHub repository where releases can be freely downloaded from
 * <code>https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases/download/{release-name}</code>. The {@code api.github.com}'s
 * {@code /releases} end point delivers the releases in descending chronological order, so newest releases first. With
 * this, we can cache old results and try to get along with the harsh rate limit of only 60 requests per hour when used
 * without authentication.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Due to the harsh rate limits we restrict loading even of the first page to once every two minutes; multiple requests
 * within this duration will be answered from the cache. With this, a single instance of this class will typically
 * request <em>all</em> releases only once, cache all these releases, and then look for newer releases at most every two
 * minutes, thereby staying well within limits.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Enumerating the releases works through the inner class {@link ReleaseIterator}. If the last loading request for the
 * first page happened more than those two minutes ago, another such request will be made and the new, yet uncached
 * releases obtained from it will be added to the cache. Then, enumeration starts on the cache, delivering the newest
 * release first. When the oldest cached element has been delivered through the iterator, the next action depends on
 * whether or not the cache {@link #cacheContainsOldestRelease contains the oldest release} already. If so, no older
 * release can exist, and iteration ends. Otherwise, more requests for further paginated release documents are sent
 * until no more pages are found or releases older than the so far oldest release from the cache are found and added to
 * the cache. Iteration then continues on the cache again.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The class is thread-safe in that it allows multiple threads to obtain iterators on a single instance of this class.
 * The loading and caching of releases pages from GitHub, the invocation of the {@link #iterator()} method and the
 * {@link ReleaseIterator#hasNext()} and {@link ReleaseIterator#next()} methods all obtain this object's monitor
 * ({@code synchronized}). This may cause one iterator having to wait for another iterator's implicit loading actions.
