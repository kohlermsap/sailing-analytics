/**
 * Given a {@link GPSFixTrack} containing {@link GPSFixMoving}, an instance of this class finds areas on the track where
 * the course changes sufficiently quickly and far to indicate a relevant maneuver. The basis for the duration to
 * consider is the {@link BoatClass}'s {@link BoatClass#getApproximateManeuverDuration() maneuver duration}. The basis
 * for the angular threshold is {@link BoatClass#getManeuverDegreeAngleThreshold()}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Analyzing the track works with a {@link FixWindow analysis window} that contains up to a certain duration worth of
 * GPS fixes, keeping track of their respective {@link SpeedWithBearing} COG/SOG vectors as well as the cumulative
 * course change counted from the beginning of the window up to each of the fixes stored in the window. Course changes
 * within the window are all in the same {@link NauticalSide direction} (so either all to {@link NauticalSide#PORT PORT}
 * or all to {@link NauticalSide#STARBOARD STARBOARD}). When a fix addition leads to a maximum cumulative course change
 * exceeding the threshold, a maneuver candidate is added to {@link #maneuverCandidates}, and the fixes from the start
 * of the window up to the fix where the
 * <p>
 * 
 * When a fix is added to the window that at the insertion point leads to a change in COG change direction, all fixes
 * from the beginning of the window up to the fix preceding the one added are removed, so the window now starts with a
 * course change in the other direction. If the fix insert position was not at the end of the window, the course change
 * direction from the fix added to the next fix is also checked for consistency with the first course change direction
 * of the window.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Upon construction, all maneuver candidates for all fixes already contained by the {@link GPSFixTrack} are determined.
 * They can be requested in total or as a subset using {@link #approximate(TimePoint, TimePoint)}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This object {@link GPSFixTrack#addListener(GPSTrackListener) observes} the {@link GPSFixTrack} for new fixes. If a
 * new fix arrives and it has a time point newer than the last fix in the current analysis window, it is added to the
 * window, updating the {@link #maneuverCandidates maneuver candidates} accordingly. If the fix was delivered "out of
 * order" outside of the current analysis window, a temporary {@link FixWindow} is constructed, and a time range around
 * the new fix is re-scanned, again updating the set of maneuver candidates accordingly. If the out-of-order fix fell in
 * between the first and the last fix in the current analysis window, it is inserted into the window accordingly, and
 * the current window is assessed for maneuvers as usual. Being in between fixes, this case does not influence the
 * current analysis window's duration.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For concurrency control, an approximation of this type uses {@code synchronized} methods where mutations may occur
 * (particularly in the {@link #gpsFixReceived(GPSFixMoving, Competitor, boolean, AddResult)} method), as well as for
 * the {@link #approximate(TimePoint, TimePoint)} method which is the "reading" accessor. Furthermore, object
 * serialization obtains this object's monitor by making the {@link #writeObject} method {@code synchronized}.
