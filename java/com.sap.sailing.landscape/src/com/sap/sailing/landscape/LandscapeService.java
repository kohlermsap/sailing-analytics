     *            specifies the type of instance launched for hosting the new master process in case a shared masted
     *            instance is requested by setting {@code newSharedMasterInstance} to {@code true}, and for launching an
     *            instance for a first replica not managed by an auto-scaling group in case

     *            replicas. Must not be {@code null}.

     * @param optionalMemoryInMegabytesOrNull
     *            if not {@code null}, specifies the heap size to allocate for the master and replica processes each, in
     *            MB (1024*1024B); if provided, this takes precedence over anything specified in
     *            {@code optionalMemoryTotalSizeFactorOrNull}.
     * @param optionalMemoryTotalSizeFactorOrNull
     *            if not {@code null} and if {@code optionalMemoryInMegabytesOrNull} does not specify an absolute heap
     *            size, this parameter specifies how much memory to allocate for application processes on shared
     *            instances (which does not include dedicated auto-scaling replicas); the amount is specified as a
     *            fraction of the "physical" RAM (as seen by the operating system running on the instance) minus some
     *            space reserved for the operating system itself and for the Java VM. It can be thought of as an
     *            approximation for how many processes configured this way will fit into the instance's physical memory
     *            without the need for massive swapping activity. The parameter will be ignored for a new dedicated
     *            master instance where we assume that almost all physical RAM shall be made available to the process.
     * @param optionalIgtimiRiotPort
     *            if non-{@code null}, this will be used for the
     *            {@link SailingProcessConfigurationVariables#IGTIMI_RIOT_PORT} variable in both, primary/master and
     *            replica.
     * @param minimumAutoScalingGroupSize
     *            if {@code 0}, a replica process will be started on a shared host that must run in an availability zone
     *            different from the one on which the master process runs. If no such shared host exists that is
     *            eligible to receive a process deployment for the new replica set (e.g., based on available port
     *            restrictions), a new shared host is launched, using the same instance type specification provided for
     *            the master ({@code masterInstanceType}). Note that for the probably somewhat unusual combination of a
     *            non-shared master instance ({@code newSharedMasterInstance==false}) and a
     *            {@code minimumAutoScalingGroupSize} of 0, a "shared" host that needs to be launched for the first
     *            replica will inherit an instance type from the master's configuration that may not be suited too well
     *            for sharing. Eligibility considerations and precedence rules are then hoped to rank such instances to
     *            the bottom of the list based, e.g., on their available physical / swap memory ratio, so that they
     *            would hardly ever get chosen as a deployment target for other replica's shared instances.
